**Subject:** Introduction to the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v4.0.3"

**Description of the talk:** 
OWASP’s Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is one of the few comprehensive guides of security requirements for applications. The 4.0 version, released in March 2019 represents a significant update with many new features as well as structural changes. In this talk, Josh, one of the project co-leaders, will go through what the ASVS is and how it is put together with a particular focus on what has changed in this new version. He will also talk through some of the more interesting new requirements and show how you can help shape the future of this important standard.
